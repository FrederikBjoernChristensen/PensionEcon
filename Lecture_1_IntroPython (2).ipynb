    "# Pension Economics Part 2: Introduction to Quantitative Pension Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the course, we gently introduce you to quantitative life cycle models that are often used in economics to study life-cycle planning, retirement decisions, pension systems, and pension system reform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, there are in-class exercises to illustrate important concepts. We are here to help and hope that you participate actively by solving the exercises. At the end of each exercise, we provide our suggested solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will we be doing?\n",
    "* Economists use different softwares to solve their models\n",
    "    * Python, Matlab, Julia, Fortran, C...\n",
    "    * We will use Python, as it is open source, easy to learn, and extremely popular in both business and research\n",
    "    * When you know one programming language, you basically know them all\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* To run Python, we rely on the Anaconda distribution which can be downloaded here:\n",
    "    * https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* With the exception of a few simple exercises, we provide you with all the code you need\n",
    "    * And if you have a question, do not hesitate to ask for help\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nothing can go wrong! So don't be afraid to play around with the code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are quantitative models important?\n",
    "### Toy models are useful for intuition\n",
    "* Provide simple but useful economic insights about\n",
    "    * Consumption-saving decisions\n",
    "    * Basic structure of different pension systems\n",
    "    * In models not covered here, they can also provide insights on labor supply etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can be solved pen-to-paper on a so called closed form\n",
    "    * Example of equation with a closed form:    \n",
    "        \\begin{align*}\n",
    "            exp\\left(x\\right)=5 \\longrightarrow x = ln\\left(5\\right)\n",
    "        \\end{align*}\n",
    "    * Example of equation without a closed form:\n",
    "        \\begin{align*}\n",
    "            exp\\left(x\\right)+x=5 \\longrightarrow x = ?\n",
    "        \\end{align*}\n",
    "    * Without closed-form solutions, we can sometimes compute a numerical solution using computational methods!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple models often guide our ideas for more sophisticated models\n",
    "    * Large models and their results are often hard to interpret (Black box)\n",
    "    * In many cases, basic intuition is the economist's best friend\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### However, toy models are often too restrictive for modeling real-world outcomes\n",
    "* Require long decision horizons\n",
    "    * People rarely make decision plans over 30 or 40 year periods\n",
    "    * Makes it hard to compare model outcomes to data at shorter frequencies (monthly, quaterly, or yearly)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Require a limited number of variables\n",
    "    * Modeling individual choices other than consumption and labor quickly increases complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* And more...\n",
    "    * Hard to solve models with uncertainty, e.g. income shocks, or return shocks\n",
    "    * Hard to solve models with non-convexities, e.g. a borrowing constraint\n",
    "    * Hard to solve models with non-monotonic preferences, e.g. bequest or preferences for luxury goods\n",
    "    * Hard to solve models with ex-ante heterogeneous agents, e.g. over a skill distribution\n",
    "    * Hard to match rigid toy models to real-world data, e.g. matching the wealth distribution\n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "### When toy models are insufficient, economists often look to computational models\n",
    "* Computational solution methods allow us to solve any well-defined problem if given enough time\n",
    "    * In this course, we consider computational models that solve relatively fast\n",
    "    * Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for larger models to take days, weeks, or even months to compute\n",
